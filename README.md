# Animal Shelter Management System

The Animal Shelter Management System is a program designed for Animal Shelters/Humane Societies to track their animals. This system was created by the "Data Magic Engineering" team, who are a group of 5 FGCU Software Engineering students (the names of each member are listed down below underneath "Authors"). We started this project on September 2019, and we all chose this project for our Software Engineering Fundamentals class since it was something that we would all enjoy to work on. Everyone in our group during this time are experienced with Java and are relatively new with JavaFX. All five of us are constantly giving effort to add new features and improve the overall structure of our animal shelter management system, which shows that not only do we all work well together as a team, but we all enjoy putting forth time and effort to create something amazing and beneficial to relevant companies.

## Built With

IntelliJ IDEA 2019

IntelliJ is a Java IDE built for professional developers. Some of the best features of IntelliJ includes giving relevant suggestions for each context, which includes code suggestions, refactoring tools, and shortcuts for code completion, such as a driver method for java (psvm -> tab) and the method to print to the console (sout -> tab).
